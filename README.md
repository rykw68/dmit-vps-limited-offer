# DMIT VPS Limited-Time Offer: Up to 30% Off HKG & TYO Services

---

Tired of network instability killing your online business? DMIT's latest compensation plan isn't just an apology—it's your chance to grab premium Hong Kong and Tokyo VPS services at rarely-seen discounts. Whether you're running latency-sensitive applications or need rock-solid Asia-Pacific connectivity, this deal addresses both network reliability concerns and your budget.

## What's Really Going On Here

So DMIT got hit hard. Like, really hard. Their Hong Kong and Tokyo data centers have been under sustained DDoS attacks lately, causing the kind of network hiccups that make sysadmins lose sleep. Instead of just apologizing and moving on, they're actually doing something about it—both fixing the problem and compensating affected customers.

Here's the interesting part: they're not just throwing credits at existing customers. They're opening up some legitimate discounts for new purchases too. The cynic in me says they're trying to make up for lost revenue, but the pragmatist says "who cares, cheap VPS is cheap VPS."

## Breaking Down the Compensation (If You're Already a Customer)

### Got HKG Pro or HKG EB? Here's Your Gift

If you had an active Hong Kong Pro or Enterprise Bandwidth service before October 15, 2025, DMIT's sending you a free LAX Pro Echo server. The specs aren't mind-blowing—1 vCPU, 1GB RAM, 20GB SSD, 600GB transfer—but hey, it's free. And they're throwing in 1.3x the usual bandwidth quota, which is actually pretty decent.

The catch? You'll have to wait until mid-November when they finish expanding their LA hardware. Worth the wait for a free backup server? Probably.

### Tokyo Pro/EB Customers Get the Same Deal

Same eligibility requirements, same LAX Pro Echo freebie. If you've been dealing with unstable Tokyo connections, at least you'll have a West Coast alternative to fail over to.

### T1 Customers: Different Story, Better Deal

Here's where it gets interesting. If you're running HKG T1 or TYO T1 services, they're matching your highest monthly-cost plan with an equivalent LAX T1 server. So if you're paying top dollar for a beefy T1 TINY, you get a matching LAX T1 TINY.

Custom configurations won't transfer over, and the free period maxes out at three months, but it's still a solid compensation package. Shows they actually value their T1 customers differently.

## The Discount Codes (New Purchases)

### HKG Pro & TYO Pro: 20% Off

Promo code: **202510_HKG_TYO_PRO_20OFF_RECURRING**

Works on quarterly billing and above for regular Hong Kong and Tokyo Pro products. Not revolutionary, but 20% off premium Asia-Pacific locations? That's respectable. 

Considering the network improvements they're implementing, this might actually be the right time to jump in. They've learned their DDoS lessons the hard way—your service will probably benefit from their upgraded defenses.

### HKG T1 & TYO T1: 30% Off

Promo code: **202510_HKG_TYO_T1_30OFF_RECURRING**

This is the real winner. Thirty percent off T1 services (excluding WEE plans) for quarterly and longer terms. T1 pricing is already more aggressive than Pro, so stacking a 30% discount makes these surprisingly affordable for international-grade connectivity.

Both codes expire October 20, 2025. They don't stack with other promotions, they don't apply to existing services, and special deals are excluded. Standard promotional fine print.


## What You're Actually Getting: The Network Breakdown

### Tokyo Tier 1: International Routing

This is pure international connectivity—no China optimization. You're looking at NTT routes for China Telecom and China Unicom (with occasional Lumen detours through the US), plus CMI for China Mobile. 

Translation: decent for international audiences, not ideal if most of your traffic is mainland China. But if you need a Japanese IP for geo-targeting or content access, 👉 [skip the overpriced "Asia-optimized" marketing and get actual Tier 1 bandwidth at these discount rates](https://www.dmit.io/aff.php?aff=13832)—it'll perform better than half the "premium" options out there.

### Tokyo Premium: CN2 GIA

Now we're talking. KVM virtualization, 1Gbps bandwidth, CN2 GIA/10099(9929)/CMI routing. IPv4 and IPv6 included. Traffic overages will suspend your service (not throttle—suspend), so monitor your usage.

Test IP: 154.12.190.32

This is what you want if China connectivity matters. CN2 GIA is still the gold standard for low-latency mainland access.

### Hong Kong Tier 1

Basic international routing, similar philosophy to Tokyo T1. Test IP: 154.12.176.28

### Hong Kong Premium: CN2 GIA Glory

Here's the flagship. KVM on AMD EPYC processors, 100-500Mbps shared bandwidth depending on plan, one IPv4 and one IPv6 subnet by default.

The routing is where it shines: return path uses Hong Kong CTG connecting to CN2 GIA domestically. Outbound, China Telecom goes CN2 GIA direct to Hong Kong CTG. China Unicom uses Hong Kong 4837 plus AS10099 direct connection. China Mobile gets CMI direct to Hong Kong.

Translation: this is engineered for China connectivity, not accidentally good at it.

## Should You Actually Buy This?

Look, DMIT isn't perfect—these attacks prove that. But their response shows they're serious about both their existing customers and their network quality. The free compensation for affected users is unusually generous for this industry, and the discount codes actually represent real value, not inflated-then-discounted pricing games.

If you need Asia-Pacific VPS hosting and you've been waiting for a deal, this is probably as good as it gets this year. The Premium plans with CN2 GIA routing are legitimately hard to beat for China connectivity, and the T1 options are solid for general international use.

Just remember: promotional prices expire October 20, 2025, and if the past few months taught DMIT anything, it's that network infrastructure matters. 

For those still wondering whether to trust a provider that just weathered sustained attacks, consider this: they're not hiding the problems, they're overcompensating affected customers, and they're actively upgrading their defenses. That's actually how you want a hosting company to respond to adversity. Sometimes you learn more about a provider from how they handle disasters than from their uptime during peacetime.

## Wrapping This Up

DMIT's turning a rough patch into an opportunity—both for themselves and potential customers. The compensation for existing users shows they value retention, while the discount codes offer newcomers a legitimate entry point into premium Asia-Pacific hosting.

Between network improvements prompted by recent attacks and genuinely useful promotional pricing, this might be the right moment to lock in annual or longer terms. The Premium plans with CN2 GIA remain particularly strong for China-facing applications, while T1 services offer reliable international connectivity at newly competitive prices.

If you've been evaluating Asia-Pacific VPS options, 👉 [these DMIT deals represent the most substantial discount window in recent memory for proven infrastructure](https://www.dmit.io/aff.php?aff=13832)—especially considering they're actively hardening their network against the exact issues that prompted these promotions.
